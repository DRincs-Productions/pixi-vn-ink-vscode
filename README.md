# *ink* Language - Visual Studio Code Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension for the ***ink*** scripting language, used in interactive narrative games (e.g. *80 Days*, *Heaven's Vault*).  
This extension provides **syntax highlighting**, support for **variables, constants, lists, logic, conditional choices**, **INCLUDE statements**, **tags**, **interactive narrative preview**, and built-in **error checking**, making it easier to write and maintain *ink* scripts.
