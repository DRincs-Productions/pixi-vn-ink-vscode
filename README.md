# *ink* - VS Code Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension for the ***ink*** scripting language, used in interactive narrative games (e.g. *80 Days*, *Heaven's Vault*).  
This extension provides **syntax highlighting**, support for **variables, logic, conditional choices**, and built-in **error checking**, making it easier to write and maintain *ink* scripts.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Full syntax highlighting**:
  - Variable (`VAR`) and constant (`CONST`) declarations
  - Temporary variables (`temp`)
  - Knots, stitches, and parameters
  - Logical expressions with operators (`+ - * / % not == != < > <= >=`)
  - Math functions (`POW`, `RANDOM`, `INT`, `FLOOR`, `FLOAT`)
  - Strings, numbers, and booleans
  - Choices and conditional choices
  - Printing variables and conditional text inside `{ }`

- **Integrated error checking**:
  - Real-time analysis powered by [inkjs](https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs)
  - Syntax and logic errors reported directly in the editor
  - Support for warnings and errors

<!-- - **File icon support**:
  - `.ink` files have a dedicated icon in the VS Code file tree -->

  - **Printing variables** (`{ variableName }`)
  - **Logic and arithmetic operators**
  - **Variable and constant declarations**

## üìù TODO

The following features and improvements are planned for future versions of this extension:

- Complete the syntax highlighting for all Ink constructs.
- Add and improve hover pop-ups above knots, functions, and variables.
- Enable CTRL+Click functionality for knots, functions, and variables.
- Allow folding/collapsing of knots and functions.
- Add the ability to import Ink files:
  - Users can specify an entire folder or define a `main.ink` file.
  - If no main file is defined, the current file will be treated as the main file.
- Add a preview panel similar to Inky.
- Add a counter for knots and word count within the current file.
- Add a flag to enable syntax highlighting for Markdown:
  - Ink does not natively support Markdown, but some projects may benefit from this feature.
- Add a flag to enable syntax highlighting for Pixi'VN:
  - A JavaScript game engine that uses Ink scripts.
